    "The National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) is a panel survey with repeated interviews of a group of Americans born in the early 1980s. Here is a quote from the [documentation page at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm):\n",

    ">    The NLSY97 consists of a nationally representative sample of 8,984 men and women born during the years 1980 through 1984 and living in the United States at the time of the initial survey in 1997.  Participants were ages 12 to 16 as of December 31, 1996.  Interviews were conducted annually from 1997 to 2011 and biennially since then.  The ongoing cohort has been surveyed 18 times as of date.  Data are available from Round 1 (1997-98) through Round 19 (2019-20). \n",
